<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

I love the overall design of this landing page from the typography to the color choice. It was very clean, and it was a treat to lay out with CSS. This was also good practice for me to try out absolutely-positioned elements. I think being able to remove an element from the normal document flow and positioning it wherever you need it to be opens up a lot of great opportunities for creative layouts.

The caption card below the hero image was a good exercise for this and was my first real take at using absolute positioning for dynamic element placement.
